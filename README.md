🔹 **Gesture to Voice Converter:** The default mode empowers users with seamless gesture recognition, seamlessly translating hand movements into clear and concise voice commands. This feature is a game-changer for individuals with speech impairments or those seeking hands-free communication, significantly enhancing accessibility.

🔹 **Wheelchair Control:** The second mode shatters barriers by offering intuitive wheelchair control functionalities. By harnessing natural hand gestures, users gain precise and effortless control over their wheelchairs, fostering newfound independence and mobility.

**Purpose-driven at its core**, the project is committed to:

🎯 **Enhancing Accessibility:** By bridging the gap between gesture recognition technology and real-world applications, we're driving towards a more inclusive society.

🌐 **Fostering Independence:**It will empower individuals with disabilities to navigate their environments and communicate effectively, championing independence and autonomy.

🚀 **Driving Innovation:** The relentless pursuit of pushing boundaries in assistive technology is paving the way for future advancements and opportunities.

**Technologies Utilized:**
1. Microcontrollers: Esp32 (for smart gloves), Arduino Uno (for wheelchair).
2. Flex sensor (for gesture sensing).
3. Df mini player (MP3 playback).
4. NRF transceiver.
5. Motor driver L298N.

**Software Utilized:** Arduino IDE.

**Communication Protocols Utilized:** UART, SPI.
